# Inclusive Web: Building Accessible Websites. Hackathon
## Project Overview

This project aims to create websites that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Inclusive web design incorporates accessibility best practices, ensuring that websites are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for users with diverse needs, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers, voice recognition software, or specialized input devices.

The goal of this project is to empower developers to implement features and structures that adhere to accessibility standards (such as WCAG), making digital content truly inclusive for all users.



## Why
**Inclusion** has recently become a widely discussed topic, with one key focus being the inclusion of people with disabilities. This includes individuals with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.
The objective of this project is to **raise awareness** about the importance of accessible websites and to provide **a template or resource** that developers can rely on when building inclusive websites.

## Target audiance
*Web developers, people with disability and everyone who is interested in inclusion.*

## Criteria of Success

1. Delivering a website that is first point of contact for people who would like to gain practical framework and features for accessible websites.
2. Delivering the project on time (on or before the 18th of November 2024).
3. Users of the webiste would find it easy to navigate and utilise.
4. Raising the awarness that not only building accessible websites are essentail but actually easy to achieve using the current website.

## Getting Started

First, fork the repository. Then, go into your preferred code editor.

1. git clone [https://github.com/VCGithubCode/accessOk]
2. cd game
3. npm install
4. npm run serve

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
   - Alternatively, Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now-published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY] in.
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

8. $ git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY]
9. Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
10. remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
11. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
12. remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
13. Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
