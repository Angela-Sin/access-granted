## Project Overview

This project aims to create websites that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Inclusive web design incorporates accessibility best practices, ensuring that websites are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for users with diverse needs, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers, voice recognition software, or specialized input devices.

This project aims to empower developers to implement features and structures that adhere to accessibility standards (such as WCAG), making digital content inclusive for all users.

## Criteria of Success

1. Delivering a website that is the first point of contact for people who would like to gain a practical framework and features for accessible websites.
2. Delivering the project on time (on or before the 18th of November 2024).
3. Website users would find it easy to navigate and utilize.
4. Raising the awareness that not only building accessible websites is essential but easy to achieve using the current website.

# User Goal

### As a visually impaired user, I benefit from the high contrast mode and larger text options, making the site easier to read.

- The "Accessibility Features" dropdown menu allows me to toggle these options without any hassle.
- I can also switch to the OpenDyslexic font, reducing visual stress while reading the content.
  
### As a user with color blindness, I appreciate the built-in colorblind modes like deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia filters.

- I can see and differentiate the content, images, and icons by selecting the appropriate filter.
- As someone who relies on voice commands, I can easily enable the Voice Control feature.
- This allows me to navigate the site hands-free, making it convenient for individuals with mobility impairments.
  
### As a user exploring the site for resources, I find the navigation menu intuitive and straightforward.

- The links to the "Resources," "About," and "Contact" pages are visible and accessible.
- The "Skip to main content" link at the top ensures that I can bypass repetitive navigation and quickly access the core content.
  
### As a person who values inclusive design, I am delighted to see the comprehensive range of accessibility options.

- I can customize the theme (light, dark, high contrast) and font themes to suit my preferences, making my browsing experience more comfortable.
  
### As a user looking for help, the Contact page is easy to find.

- I can fill out a simple form, providing my name, email, and message, and expect a prompt response from the team.
- The site's address and contact information are also clearly listed, offering multiple ways to get in touch.
  
### As a user interested in learning about accessibility, I can navigate to the "Accessibility Guide".

- This page offers helpful tips and information on using the website's features effectively, demonstrating the project’s commitment to inclusivity.

## Our Contributions

### HTML Structure

- Uses modern HTML5 with semantic tags for accessibility (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>).
- Includes lang=" en" and meta tags for viewport settings and character encoding, ensuring proper rendering across devices.
- Utilizes data-bs-theme for theme customization, allowing dynamic switching between light, dark, and high-contrast modes.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- Bootstrap 5: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system, components, and responsive design features.
- Bootstrap Icons: Integrated for icon usage (e.g., social media links).
- Custom CSS and JavaScript: Separate custom styles (style.css) and scripts (script.js, theme-switcher.js) for enhanced functionality.

### Accessibility Features

- Dedicated dropdown for accessibility options, including:
- Font size adjustment (via a range input).
- Toggle switches for Dyslexic Font, High Contrast, and Simplified Layout.
- Dropdown selection for different colorblind modes (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia).
- Theme selection (Auto, Light, Dark, High Contrast).
- Voice control toggle, suggesting integration with a voice assistant feature.
- Link to a detailed Accessibility Guide.

### Header and Navigation

- Sticky header with a responsive navbar, including links to:
- Home, Resources, About, and Contact pages.
- Accessibility features dropdown with a comprehensive list of settings.

### Main Content

- A hero section with:
- A welcoming message.
- A call-to-action button ("Explore Our Features").
- An image representing the brand (e.g., lock icon).
- A feature showcase using Bootstrap cards with shadow and responsiveness:
- Voice Assistant: Aimed at users needing assistive technology.
- OpenDyslexic Font: Improves readability for users with dyslexia.
- High Contrast Mode: Enhances visibility for those with visual impairments.

### SVG Filters for Colorblind Modes

- Defines three colorblind filters (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia) using feColorMatrix, which adjusts color perception on the webpage.

### Footer Section

- Divided into three columns:
- Resources: Links to documentation, tutorials, and support.
- Social Media Links: Icons for Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
- Site Map: Quick navigation links for Home, About, Resources, and Contact pages.
- Copyright information with a "Back to top" link.

### JavaScript Integration
   
- Uses Bootstrap's JavaScript Bundle for interactive components.
- Includes a custom script (theme-switcher.js) for handling theme and font changes.
- Custom script.js likely manages additional interactivity and accessibility features.

### Design and User Experience
    
- Consistent design language: Uses Bootstrap's default styling with light customizations (e.g., shadow, background images).
- Responsive layout: Ensures compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Focus on inclusivity: Emphasizes features aimed at making the site usable for users with various disabilities.
