# Project Overview

This project aims to create websites that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Inclusive web design incorporates accessibility best practices, ensuring that websites are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for users with diverse needs, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers, voice recognition software, or specialized input devices.

This project aims to empower developers to implement features and structures that adhere to accessibility standards (such as WCAG), making digital content inclusive for all users.

# Criteria of Success

The "Access Granted" project aims to make the web more accessible for all users, focusing on features like voice assistance, dyslexia-friendly fonts, and high-contrast modes for users with visual impairments. The site incorporates customizable accessibility settings, including font size adjustments, dyslexia-friendly fonts, colorblind modes, and high-contrast themes to enhance the user experience. It is dedicated to breaking down barriers and creating an inclusive, user-friendly digital environment.

- We have designed an immersive and intuitive user interface, ensuring that our design is not only visually distinctive but also delivers a smooth and engaging user experience.

- The success of our project is a result of careful planning and execution. We leveraged GitHub Projects for effective organization and complemented this with a detailed README.md to ensure transparency and keep our development on track.

- Our work is strongly aligned with the Hackathon's theme, presenting forward-thinking and creative solutions that push the boundaries of innovation. This project sets a new standard, paving the way for future developments.

- We’ve created a responsive, accessible, and well-tested application, emphasizing user experience across various devices and catering to diverse accessibility requirements.

- Our project introduces unique features and functionality, adding significant value and fostering engagement.

- A key strength of our project lies in the collaborative effort of our team. Through active involvement, inclusive practices, and a shared commitment to excellence, we’ve cultivated an environment of mutual support and high-quality outcomes.

- As someone who relies on voice commands, I can easily enable the Voice Control feature.
- This allows me to navigate the site hands-free, making it convenient for individuals with mobility impairments.
  
### As a user exploring the site for resources, I find the navigation menu intuitive and straightforward.

- The links to the "Resources," "About," and "Contact" pages are visible and accessible.
- The "Skip to main content" link at the top ensures that I can bypass repetitive navigation and quickly access the core content.
  
### As a person who values inclusive design, I am delighted to see the comprehensive range of accessibility options.

- I can customize the theme (light, dark, high contrast) and font themes to suit my preferences, making my browsing experience more comfortable.
  
### As a user looking for help, the Contact page is easy to find.

- I can fill out a simple form, providing my name, email, and message, and expect a prompt response from the team.
- The site's address and contact information are also clearly listed, offering multiple ways to get in touch.
  
### As a user interested in learning about accessibility, I can navigate to the "Accessibility Guide".

Click [Here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.

-  #### Obtaining EmailJS API 

  1. Sign up for a [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) account in the EmailJS website.
  2. Create an email service in your EmailJS dashboard.
  3. Install EmailJS Library. You can do this by including the EmailJS script in your HTML file or by installing it via npm if you're using a package manager like npm or yarn.

```
npm install --save @emailjs/browser
```

or

```
$ yarn add @emailjs/browser
```
  4. In your EmailJS dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section and copy your API key.
  5. Add this code snippet before your closing tags. Making sure you have added your public key.

```js
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(){
      emailjs.init({
        publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      });
  })();
</script>
```

  6.  Create an email template in your EmailJS dashboard. This template will define the content and structure of the emails you'll send.
  7. Write JavaScript function to send email using EmailJS. Below is a basic syntax for the code: 

```
emailjs.send(serviceID, templateID, templateParams, options);
```

  8. Call your function whenever you want to send an email.
