Our project follows the Agile methodology, a framework that enables us to tackle the inherent unpredictability of software development through incremental, iterative work cycles, known as sprints. This approach promotes adaptability and allows us to respond quickly to changes, which is crucial in the fast-paced world of software development.

At the beginning of each sprint, our team conducts sprint planning to set the course for the upcoming work. This includes prioritizing the product backlog to address the most important tasks first, establishing clear sprint goals aligned with project milestones, and assigning tasks based on expertise and workload. During development, we carefully manage trade-offs between scope, quality, time, and resources to ensure a balance between delivering high-quality work and meeting deadlines. By adopting Agile methodologies, we stay adaptable and focused, ensuring that we meet user needs while striving for excellence.

#### Obtaining EmailJS API 

1. Sign up for a [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) account in the EmailJS website.
2. Create an email service in your EmailJS dashboard.
3. Install EmailJS Library. You can do this by including the EmailJS script in your HTML file or by installing it via npm if you're using a package manager like npm or yarn.

```
npm install --save @emailjs/browser
```

or

```
$ yarn add @emailjs/browser
```
4. In your EmailJS dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section and copy your API key.
5. Add this code snippet before your closing tags. Making sure you have added your public key.

```js
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(){
      emailjs.init({
        publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      });
  })();
</script>
```

6.  Create an email template in your EmailJS dashboard. This template will define the content and structure of the emails you'll send.
7. Write JavaScript function to send email using EmailJS. Below is a basic syntax for the code: 

```
emailjs.send(serviceID, templateID, templateParams, options);
```

8. Call your function whenever you want to send an email.
