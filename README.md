# Agile Methodology

## Sprint Process and Team Workflow
At the beginning of each sprint, our team conducts Sprint Planning to set the course for the upcoming work. This process includes:

- Prioritizing the Product Backlog: We ensure the most important tasks are addressed first, focusing on features and improvements that bring the most value to users.
- Setting Sprint Goals: Clear goals are established, aligned with project milestones, to provide direction and ensure we stay on track.
- Assigning Tasks: Tasks are distributed based on each team member’s expertise and workload to promote efficiency and collaboration.
Throughout the sprint, we carefully manage trade-offs between scope, quality, time, and resources. Our aim is to deliver high-quality work while meeting deadlines and user needs. By adopting Agile methodologies, we remain adaptable, focused, and committed to continuous improvement.

## Task Prioritization Using MOSCOW
Tasks are organized using the MOSCOW method, which helps us prioritize and manage our work effectively:

- Must Have: Essential features or tasks that are critical for the success of the project and must be completed in the current sprint.
Should Have: Important tasks that are not essential but should be completed if possible, as they will improve the user experience or functionality.
- Could Have: Tasks that are nice to have but are not critical. These may be included if there is time available after the must-have and should-have tasks are completed.
- Won’t Have: Tasks that are not a priority for the current sprint and will be deferred or removed from the current scope.
This prioritization technique allows us to focus on the most important tasks first, ensuring that we are always addressing the highest-value work.

## Team Meetings Summary
### First Team Meeting:

Our first team meeting took place with Vernell, Nicola, and Ben, where we introduced ourselves and discussed the project's objectives. In this session, we:

- Planned the project schedule.
- Decided on a team name. Initially, it was "Access Ok," but after a team vote, it was changed to "Access Granted."
- Brainstormed ideas for our project’s page. The first suggestion was to create a platform for people with visual impairments, incorporating voice control and vision accessibility. Vernell later proposed expanding the concept to include options for individuals with dyslexia, enhancing the project's inclusivity.

### Second Team Meeting:

The following day, new team members joined us. During this meeting, we:

- Introduced ourselves and shared our skills and availability.
- Assigned tasks and responsibilities to ensure a smooth workflow and alignment of efforts across the team.

### Ongoing Daily Meetings:

After the initial meetings, our team continued with two daily sessions:

- Sprint Planning Meeting (10:00 AM): During this meeting, we:

- - Provide status updates on tasks.
- - Assign or reassign tasks based on each team member’s progress and workload.

- Retrospective Meeting (6:00 PM): 
- - At the retrospective, we reflect on the sprint, evaluate what went well, and identify areas for improvement to ensure smoother workflows and a more efficient development process.

### Informal Meetings:

Throughout the day, team members can meet informally and make decisions without the presence of the full team or SCRUM lead. These meetings are facilitated through Slack, where status updates on tasks are shared, and decisions are communicated to keep the project board updated.

## Kanban Board for Task Management
To manage and visualize the workflow, we use a Kanban board. This tool helps us track the progress of tasks across different stages of development. Tasks are moved through the following columns:

- To Do: Tasks that need to be started.
- In Progress: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
- Review: Completed tasks that are being reviewed or tested.
- Done: Fully completed tasks.
By using the Kanban board, we ensure that tasks are organized and transparent, making it easy for team members to see the overall project status and ensure that work is progressing smoothly.

## MVP Focus and Collaboration
In the early stages, the team worked towards creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). As the team adjusted to working together, we found our balance, rhythm, and flow state. Over time, we transitioned from working individually to collaborating more closely, solving problems together, and helping each other complete tasks effectively.
